# Exercise-6: Data analysis II
This week we have two versions of the exercise, one for the geography course, and one for the geology course:

- **Automating GIS Processes:** [Data Analysis with Pandas II](pandas)
- **Intro to Quantitative Geology:** [Data Analysis with NumPy II](NumPy)

Please complete the exercise related to the course you have signed up for (and plan to continue with in period 2). Those not continuing in either course are free to choose which exercise they will complete.
